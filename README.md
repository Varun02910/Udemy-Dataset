# Udemy-Dataset
This project analyzed a Udemy course dataset to uncover interesting trends. The highest priced course was only 200 Rs and the longest course offered 78.5 hours of content. The average course costs 66 Rs. Interestingly, the number of lectures and content duration were positively correlated, suggesting longer courses offered more in-depth learning. Similarly, the number of subscriptions and reviews were positively correlated, indicating popular courses received more engagement. Notably, 91.6% of Udemy courses were paid. We also discovered the most and least reviewed courses, "The Web Development Bootcamp" and "Beginning Accounting" respectively. The data suggests a connection between course level and price/duration, with beginner courses being cheaper and shorter while intermediate courses offered more content at a higher price point. Finally, the visualization revealed a trend toward users preferring lower priced courses.
